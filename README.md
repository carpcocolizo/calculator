// README!
// This is another JavaScript project for ODIN
// I am going to build a web browser calculator 
// 
// Well, I have finish, it took me a long time, but i did it
// I think it looks great, and it works perfectly
// Like in every ocasion I could have made it more simple in the code
// But I want to share it now, I will take a look to the code late, and see if I can do it more simple
// Maybe in a later time I will add keyboard support
// I wish to be more simple the process to add to events to the same element
// I have to rework everything, maybe asign a function to the event and use the same function as reference for the keyboard event
// But for now it will be like it is 
// Thank you for reading
